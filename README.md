##Introduction

A quick analysis of the Titanic dataset.


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python 3.8
* Pandas, Numpy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-Learn
  * GaussianNB
  * SVC
  * Ensemble
  * GradientBoostingClassifier
  * KNeighborsRegressor
  * MLPClassifier
  * LogisticRegression
  * Train Test Split
  * Cross Validation Score
  * ROC Curve, AUC
  * StandardScaler
  * Classification report, Confusion matrix
  * Precision score, Accuracy Score
  * R2 Score
  * PCA


### Instructions

In this repository I compared the prediction of survived passengers with several algorithms, from GradientBoosting to Multi-layer Perceptron classifier, as well as a Principal component analysis of the dataset.
If you wish you to take a look, start with the notebook entitled: Titanic(age_by_mean)_PCA_LogisticRegression, where all the data is prepared.
Then you can read in any order you wish to, and finally, you can read my conclusions in the Ttanic_Analysis pdf.
