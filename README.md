# PlayingAround
A few examples of what I am up to.

Check each folder for a different project.

Slidings is a machine learning approach to estimate the probability of a land sliding on a given location in the city of Recife, Brazil, using the public datasets provided by the government.
You can see more about it in the Next-Machine Learning repository.


There is also my analysis of the titanic dataset in (you guessed!) the folder Titanic:

In this analysis I compared several algorithms, if you wish you to take a look, start with the notebook 'Titanic(age_by_mean)_PCA_LogisticRegression', then open any other in the order you wish to, and then, you can read my conclusions in the Titanic_Analysis pdf.
