# PlayingAround
A few examples of what I am up to.
Check each folder for a different project.

For now there is only my analysis of the titanic dataset in, you guess, titanic folder:
I compared several algorithms, if you wish you to take a look, start with the notebook 'Titanic(age_by_mean)_PCA_LogisticRegression', then open any other in the order you wish to, and you can read my conclusions in the Titanic_Analysis pdf.
